    <p>Here you are... at the entrance; the mouth of a cave... or catacombs.</p>

    <p>There's a single point of light shining down, in a cone,
        towards the dirt where you stand. You stand alone at the center.
        In front of you is this mouth leading underground. You walked through
        woods to get here, but this point emitter illuminates none of that;
        Only the footsteps that lead you here, in the dirt behind you.</p>

    <p>The outcomes will be arranged, but there's always choice. You can always
        close the book, or skip a page. But there's something in there for you,
        something new.
